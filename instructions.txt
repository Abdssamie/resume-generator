The YAML Input File¶
RenderCV uses a single YAML file to generate your CV. This file has four top-level fields:

Your_Name_CV.yaml

cv:
  ...
  # Your content (name, sections, entries)
  ...
design:
  ...
  # Visual styling (theme, colors, fonts, spacing)
  ...
locale:
  ...
  # Language strings (month names, "present", etc.)
  ...
settings:
  ...
  # RenderCV behavior (current date, bold keywords)
  ...
Only cv is required. The others have sensible defaults.




cv Field¶
Header Information¶
The cv field begins with your personal information. All fields are optional. RenderCV adapts to whatever you provide.


cv:
  name: John Doe
  headline: Machine Learning Engineer
  location: San Francisco, CA
  email: john@example.com 
  phone: +14155551234 
  website: https://johndoe.dev 
  photo: photo.jpg
  social_networks:
    - network: LinkedIn 
      username: johndoe
    - network: GitHub
      username: johndoe
  custom_connections:
    - placeholder: Book a call 
      url: https://cal.com/johndoe
      fontawesome_icon: calendar-days
Sections¶
The sections field holds the main content of your CV. It's a dictionary where:

Keys are section titles (displayed as headings). Section titles can be anything.
Values are lists of entries

cv:
  name: John Doe

  sections:
    summary:
      - Software engineer with 10 years of experience in distributed systems.

    experience:
      - company: Acme Corp
        position: Senior Engineer
        start_date: 2020-01
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - Led migration to microservices architecture
          - Reduced deployment time by 80%

    education:
      - institution: MIT
        area: Computer Science
        degree: BS
        start_date: 2012-09
        end_date: 2016-05

    skills:
      - label: Languages
        details: Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript
      - label: Infrastructure
        details: Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS
Section names are just titles. You can use any of the 9 entry types in any section. Choose what works best for your content.

For example, experience section could use NormalEntry:


sections:
  experience:
    - name: Acme Corp — Senior Engineer
      start_date: 2020-01
      end_date: present
      highlights:
        - Led migration to microservices architecture
Or BulletEntry for a minimal style:


sections:
  experience:
    - bullet: "**Acme Corp** — Senior Engineer (2020–present)"
    - bullet: "**StartupXYZ** — Founding Engineer (2018–2020)"
One entry type per section

Each section must contain only one type of entry. For example, you cannot mix ExperienceEntry and EducationEntry in the same section.

Text Formatting & Features¶
Using Markdown¶
All text fields support basic Markdown:


highlights:
  - Increased revenue by **$2M** annually
  - Developed [open-source tool](https://github.com/example) with *500+ stars*
**text** → bold
*text* → italic
[text](url) → hyperlink
`code` → code
Using Typst¶
All text fields support

Typst math (surround with $$ like $$f(x) = x^2$$)
Typst commands (like #emph[emphasized]).

highlights:
  - Showed that $$f(x) = x^2$$ is a parabola
  - "This is an #emph[emphasized] text"
Arbitrary Keys¶
You can add arbitrary keys to any entry. By default, they're ignored, but you can reference them in design.templates field. See Arbitrary Keys in Entries for more information.

    position: Founder
    start_date: 2020-01
    end_date: present
    revenue: $5M ARR  # Custom field
    highlights:

design Field¶
The design field controls every visual aspect of your CV: colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.

Built-in Themes¶
RenderCV includes 5 built-in themes. To use one, simply specify the theme:


design:
  theme: classic
Available themes: classic (default), engineeringclassic, engineeringresumes, moderncv, sb2nov.

All themes are identical except for their default values. If you specify a setting explicitly, it overrides the theme's default. This means:

If you specify all design options in your YAML, changing the theme has no effect
If you leave settings unspecified, changing the theme completely changes the design (because it uses different defaults)
You can start with any theme and customize only what you want to change
Customizing Design¶
You can override any field to fine-tune the theme:


design:
  theme: classic
  colors:
    name: rgb(255, 0, 0)  # Override just the name color
Or specify all options for complete control:


design:
  theme: classic
